On the dot product interiority test, I don't think you have to assume that p1, p2, p3 are in counter-clockwise order. Just continue with the rest, and if the dot products /are all the same sign/ then you're on the same side of all, and thus inside. (You could not be on the /outside/ of them all is why this works.)

You are totally right.

Nice article!

I am trying out the second one (parametric equations system). I am wondering however: in the calculations the denominator could be zero. Could this happen in practise? What would this mean geometrically if this was the case?

Usually, 0 value for denominator happens for degenerate cases.

For example, when you try to find the intersection of 2 lines using a parametric system, you face a 0 value when lines are parallel.

In our case our system try to find the p coordinates as a linear combination of [p1, p2] and {p1, p3]. So what are our degenerate cases ? For example, when p2 = p3 ! Meaning your triangle is collapsed as a flat line !

so first you have to test if the triangle is in fact a triangle?

If you are not sure that your triangle is safe, better is to check it before perfoming calculation. Check if any 2 points don't overlap. But problems can still occur with points being too close from each other !

That is why in my library (Daedalus Lib) I proceeded differently. I choosed to merge points that are too close each other. For that I checked if the distance is smaller than the epsilon value.
